  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, basically all software engineering teams are now working remotely.
I’ve been part of a distributed software engineering team at Rail Europe for two and a half years,
so I thought i’d reignite my blog to pass on some tips and experience.</p>

<p>In this post I want to focus on how we communicate with each other and make decisions, whilst rarely
ever organising group video calls.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve emphasised in my previous blog posts, this isn&#8217;t about squeezing more productivity out of
your team. It&#8217;s about trusting them and giving them the space and flexibility to arange their work
day how it fits them. Scheduling loads of meetings takes away the freedom, autonomy and flexibility
that is one of the major benefits of remote work.</p>

<p>At Rail Europe <a href="/blog/2020/03/20/nothing-is-urgent-asynchronous-communication/">we prefer asynchronous communication by default</a> and part of this approach is to keep all meetings to an absolute minimum.</p>

<h2>Problems with meetings</h2>

<p>Here are some issues with meetings (video or in-person):</p>

<ul>
<li>Favours those that are best at thinking on their feet</li>
<li>Favours those with a more extrovert personality</li>
<li>Participants must stop work and be online at precisely the same time

<ul>
<li>If someone is off work, their opinion is not heard</li>
<li>Difficult with colleagues in different timezones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A one hour meeting for five people is really a five hour meeting</li>
<li>Often organised without a clear agenda</li>
<li>More effort to create a written record</li>
<li>Dominated by those in positions of power</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course a good meeting facilitator can resolve many of these issues.</p>

<h2>The alternative to meetings</h2>

<p>At Rail Europe we prefer &#8220;long form&#8221; written discussions instead of meetings. We conduct these on <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, but I&#8217;ve also used <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-team-discussions">Github Team Discussions</a> for the same purpose and it worked well.</p>

<p>We use it like a message forum – so someone starts a post on a specific topic and people reply to it.</p>

<p>These are great when you need to solicit the opinion of the wider team. Ultimately instead of calling a meeting,
you describe in detail your proposal/idea/problem and select who you want to notify.</p>

<p>We also have certain long running threads that we use in place of &#8220;status update&#8221; meetings. So instead of
scheduling a weekly catch up meeting – each time something significant happens you want to share with your
team (or even the whole company). You post an update to a specific thread. Everyone stays informed, all the
time without a meeting. This is critical for keeping people up-to-date even if they&#8217;ve had a week off on
holiday (or maybe they&#8217;ve been off ill from COVID-19!).</p>

<p>Basecamp allows you to decide if you want to be emailed each time someone replies to a post or you
can wait for the daily summary email. This fits into our idea that <a href="/blog/2020/03/20/nothing-is-urgent-asynchronous-communication/">nothing is urgent</a>.</p>

<p>For daily stand-ups, instead of holding a daily meeting, <a href="/blog/2020/03/18/stand-up-meetings-for-a-distributed-team/">we post them asynchronously on Slack</a>.</p>

<h2>Benefits of writing things down</h2>

<p>I must admit I was initially sceptical of this no meeting approach, I thought it would surely be less
efficient than having a quick-fire back and forth video chat.</p>

<p>However, written long form discussions provide many benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t require everyone online at the same time</li>
<li>Read and reply in your own time without breaking your flow</li>
<li>Requires the author (would be meeting organisor) to think through their proposal and fully articulate it</li>
<li>Allows responses to be more considered (do some research first) rather than &#8220;knee-jerk&#8221;</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re off work, you can easily catch up later</li>
<li>Level playing field for participants, not just those that &#8220;shout loudest&#8221;</li>
<li>Can read historical discussions going back years to find out <em>why</em> something was decided</li>
<li>Discussion is transparent to anyone in the company</li>
<li>Easier to bring in people from the wider team to follow and contribute</li>
</ul>


<p>Having participated in this type of team communication for a few years, I can now see that these longer,
more considered discussions, often result in a decision that has more &#8220;buy-in&#8221; from the team.
Anecdotally it also feels like we reach well thought-out solutions which, in the end save us time.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, we also avoid making team decisions in Slack and instead defer to a Basecamp post.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s not like we don&#8217;t ever have meetings. I have regular 1:1s and many tricky
problems are best resolved over real-time discussions in Slack.</p>

<p>But for my direct team consisting of 5 engineers, 2 QA testers and a product manager – we haven&#8217;t had a
meeting together in 2020 and it doesn&#8217;t look like we&#8217;ll have one any time soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of people have been thrown into remote working that aren&#8217;t used to it. I&#8217;m writing to share some tips that I hope will hopefully help reduce anxiety, stress and allow your team to work flexibly. As I mentioned before, this isn&#8217;t about squeezing more productivity
out of your colleagues.</p>

<p> Previously I wrote about how distributed teams can <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2020/03/18/stand-up-meetings-for-a-distributed-team/">adapt stand-up meetings to allow people to work more flexibly</a>. Giving them space to adapt their working day around their personal situation.</p>

<p> I&#8217;ve had to shift my working hours to start in the afternoon, as I will now look after my son in the morning whilst my wife works.
 We switch roles in the afternoon. It&#8217;s pretty much like I&#8217;m working in a US time zone when most of my team is on CET or GMT. We do
 actually have some people on UTC-7, so I already have company.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, the Rail Europe team is already geared up to communicate effectively even with people working completely
different hours, whether time zone inflicted or not&#8230;</p>

<h2>Asynchronous communication</h2>

<p> Asynchronous commuinciation is based on the idea that &#8220;nothing is urgent&#8221;, especially when it comes to writing software. This might seem blindingly obvious when we&#8217;re in the middle of a global pandemic. In reality very few of us are doing anything that&#8217;s really truely <em>urgent</em>. That&#8217;s how you describe the heroic work of people trying to create a vaccine or key-workers on the front-line.</p>

<p> However, that&#8217;s not what I mean here. A communication style where &#8220;nothing is urgent&#8221; means we don&#8217;t interrupt our colleagues and expect immediate answers right now. We use asynchronous communication by default and we are mindful about the notifications we generate for our colleagues.</p>

<p> Jason Fried from Basecamp wrote this fantastic blog post on why <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/">Group chat is like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda</a>. It informs much of our thinking.</p>

<p> I won&#8217;t pretend we are perfect at it and there is always an exception to the rule. But these are the specific (and default) behaviours we encourage amongst the tech team at Rail Europe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recognition that most questions do not need an immediate answer</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no expectation that your colleague/team is online all day

<ul>
<li>Muting of Slack channels or closing Slack entirely to avoid being interrupted is encouraged</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Team decisions are not made in Slack

<ul>
<li>We use Basecamp for long-form discussions, so everyone can contribute when it suits them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>@mention should not be used when someone is offline unless it&#8217;s critical</li>
<li>Respect Slack statuses such as &#8220;concentrating&#8221;, &#8220;lunch&#8221;, &#8220;gone for a walk&#8221;</li>
<li>Use the Lunch, Meeting or Phone status to avoid lots of pointless chatter in public channels</li>
<li>Task specific conversations that are relevant for project managers should go on Jira/Trello</li>
<li>Technical discussions about code should ideally happen on a Github PR</li>
<li>Consider an email over a Slack DM</li>
<li>Document all processes thoroughly

<ul>
<li>Good documentation allows people to be self-sufficient</li>
<li>Prevents &#8220;bus&#8221; factor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>We keep meetings down to an absolute minimum, most are replaced by long-form written discussions.
I&#8217;ll blog about this in more detail in the future.</p>

<p>Of course when I say &#8220;nothing is urgent&#8221; there are exceptions. An outage of our website and certain critical on-call alerts
need to be responded to swiftly. And it&#8217;s not like we never communicate synchronously, it&#8217;s just that async is our default.</p>

<p>Adopting asynchronous communication really has many positive benefits on the well-being of your team:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduces notification fatigue</li>
<li>Reduces anxiety about being online all the time</li>
<li>Allows people to not feel guilty about taking breaks when they need to</li>
<li>Enables more flexibility for when people work</li>
<li>Because most communication and decisions are written down, if you&#8217;re off work it&#8217;s easy to catch up later</li>
<li>Everyone sees the value in great documentation and how it empowers them to work self-sufficiently</li>
<li>Conversations on Jira/Trello make it easy for anyone to understand the latest status of a task</li>
<li>Everyone gets longer periods of uninterrupted time to get into deep work</li>
</ul>


<p>When it comes to remote work, asynchronous communication really is one of the most liberating things your
team can adopt.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This global health emergency is horrendous and thus it looks like remote working will be the new normal for some time.
I&#8217;ve been working remotely for <a href="https://raileurope.co.uk">Rail Europe</a> for two and a half years, so I thought i&#8217;d reignite my blog to pass on some tips and experience.</p>

<p>Sadly this enforced remote working scenario has the potential to amplify all the difficult parts of remote working. Namely: dealing with isolation,
fear that you need to &#8220;prove&#8221; you really are working, not separating home life from work life, amongst others.</p>

<p>To be clear, the ideas I want to share are not about squeezing out more productivity from your team. It&#8217;s about reducing
stress and anxiety, trusting people and giving them room and flexibility to breathe. Remote working is great for all these
things, but we distributed teams have to act and think differently to the typical co-located norms.</p>

<p>Anyway, I want to focus on one thing in this post&#8230;</p>

<h2>Daily Stand-ups</h2>

<p>These are really common in the tech industry. At Rail Europe we do them asynchronously. But what does that really mean?</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone writes their stand-up in a dedicated Slack channel</li>
<li>They post it (ideally) towards the beginning of their day</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no expectation that they all have to be posted at the same time</li>
<li>A stand-up message should contain 3 things:

<ul>
<li>What you worked on yesterday</li>
<li>What you plan to work on today</li>
<li>Any blockers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You&#8217;re encouraged to share how you are feeling or anything else effecting your work</li>
</ul>


<p>This last point is important because, as a distributed team, you cannot rely on normal body language cues.</p>

<p>In theory this is a relatively simple change, that can have quite a dramatic impact, in a number of positive ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s no requirement for everyone to be online all at the same time:

<ul>
<li>This gives people flexibility to start work when it works for them</li>
<li>It&#8217;s especially benefitial if your team is in multiple-timezones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&#8217;s less disruptive because you don&#8217;t need everyone to stop work at the same time.</li>
<li>For anyone off sick, or just not able to attend for any reason, they can easily catch-up on what happened while they were off</li>
<li>It&#8217;s massively more time efficient:

<ul>
<li>In-person stand-ups regularly get side-tracked off into details that are rarely relevant for the entire group</li>
<li>If someone outside your team wants a status update from you, they can read your stand-up</li>
<li>People can make their own decisions about whether they need to read every single update</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>If you need to follow up with someone on a specific point. We tend to use Slack threads or respond on the Jira Story/Trello card.</p>

<p>Ultimately the idea behind this approach is part of a wider communication strategy we have: To allow people to structure their working day how it works for them. To maximse and respect the amount of uninterupted time that we all have,
so we can focus and stay in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">the flow</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="https://github.com/rails/webpacker">rails/webpacker gem</a> is a fantastic way to configure <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> for your Rails application. However, it has gone through quite a few different configuration options to get it working with Docker.</p>

<p>Initially you could set the host by using command line arguments, but as of version 3.0.2 and <a href="https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/843">this Pull Request</a> the command line argument support was removed in favour of environment variables. By setting various environment variables you can override all dev server settings defined in <code>config/webpacker.yml</code>.</p>

<p>So now my <code>docker-compose.yml</code> config looks something like this:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This blog post runs through an example of iterating on some Ruby code. The bizarre fictional scenario
develops to make the requirements ever more complicated. There&#8217;s certainly many different ways to
solve the underlying problem, but I wanted to show an example where <code>define_method</code> and <code>instance_exec</code>
can be combined with class methods to make for some very powerful and concise code.</p>

<p>For each change in requirements, I&#8217;ll post the code in full for how I&#8217;ve handled the new scenario.</p>

<p>I will say upfront that these two metaprogramming methods should be used with caution. Powerful and concise code does not necessarily make for easy to understand/debug/maintain code.</p>

<h2>The Curry Restaurant</h2>

<p>So, there&#8217;s a curry restaurant that sells Vindaloo and Tarka Daal and there&#8217;s a customer that likes to order curry from the restaurant&#8230; bear with me :). Upon receiving their meal, the customer will respond
with a comment if the spiceyness isn&#8217;t to their taste. Unfortunately the restuarant isn&#8217;t consistent
with the spices it uses when cooking.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/f5f51b4bfa63d3ffe1833a115d9b98c3.js"></script>


<p>With the above code we can do things like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">spicey_customer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">SpiceyCustomer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">spicey_customer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order_tarka_daal</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">spicey_customer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order_vindaloo</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If any of the meals are mild then the customer will respond with &#8220;That&#8217;s too mild!&#8221;.</p>

<h2>A new greedy customer</h2>

<p>Then along comes another customer, a greedy one. They also like to order curry and comment on the meal. However, rather than comment on the spiceyness, they like to comment on the size of the portion.
Unfortunately the restuarant is also inconsistent with its porton sizes, but the greedy customer
doesn&#8217;t care what type of curry it is, they just want it large!</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/47d658b90ebea41bef9c59c26a218f35.js"></script>


<p>Already we have a bit of duplication between the two customers but it&#8217;s not a massive problem at
this point.</p>

<h2>A new menu item - Jalfrezi</h2>

<p>The restaurant is doing really well and introduces a new Jalfrezi curry to the menu. The greedy customer responds the same to it as for any curry, but the spicey customer responds to the  Jalfrezi,
the same as when recieving a Vindaloo - they want it hot!</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/2c5fe67bbba23fca6f5c7edce72adf1d.js"></script>


<p>We&#8217;ve added <code>order_jalfrezi</code> to both customers and added <code>expect_hot_curry</code> to <code>SpiceyCustomer</code> because
they respond the same for jalfrezi and vindaloo. Now we really do have duplication between the two customers, so we&#8217;ll look at refactoring that next.</p>

<h2>Refactor - Dining Out</h2>

<p>We decide that the two customers have enough shared behaviour to introduce a new module called <code>DiningOut</code>.
This means both customers can order all three currys and then respond in a way that is specific to them. With the custom response defined in each <code>Customer</code> in the <code>respond_to_meal</code> method.</p>

<p>You might be thinking it would be better to make <code>Customer</code> a class and have <code>GreedyCustomer</code> and <code>SpiceyCustomer</code> as subclasses that inherit from it, but for this example it doesn&#8217;t matter. This is a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern">Template method pattern</a>.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/dd849afecc6deea3d89e4bdcfd6fadca.js"></script>


<p>We have our new <code>DiningOut</code> module and we&#8217;ve defined a <code>respond_to_meal</code> in both customers. This code is definitely cleaner but there is still a bit of a smell.</p>

<p>If the restaurant expands with lots of new items on the menu and these customers need to respond differently, then the <code>respond_to_meal</code> method is going to get pretty big and complicated pretty quickly. We&#8217;re also
very reliant on the name of the meal not changing.</p>

<p>In addition the <code>DiningOut</code> module will bloat quickly with each new menu item. That isn&#8217;t a massive problem, but there&#8217;s already a fair bit of obvious duplication going on where the name of the order method closely matches the argument sent to <code>order_meal</code>.</p>

<p>Now you might be thinking, why can&#8217;t we just expose <code>order_meal</code> as a public method and call <code>SpiceyCustomer.new.order_meal(:jalfrezi)</code> instead of <code>SpiceyCustomer.new.order_jalfrezi</code>. However&#8230;</p>

<h2>A new fussy customer</h2>

<p>Along comes the Fussy customer who will only eat tarka daal and the newest item on the menu, chips.
The fussy customer isn&#8217;t interested in responding to the meal and just eats in silence. In addition,
the Greedy customer will order chips, but the Spicey customer would never order chips. Sounds complicated doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>The simplest thing to do is to add an <code>order_chips</code> method to <code>DiningOut</code> and an empty <code>respond_to_meal</code> to the new <code>FussyCustomer</code>.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/8848d1567653cd384ea7ee35450e9a1f.js"></script>


<p>Now we have some complicated rules and they&#8217;re not properly enforced. There&#8217;s nothing stopping us calling <code>FussyCustomer.new.order_vindaloo</code> or <code>SpiceyCustomer.new.order_chips</code> even though neither of those customers would order those things.</p>

<p>We could start putting some logic into the <code>order_*</code> methods to check the type of customer before ordering the meal, but that would get ugly fast. Ideally we want a solution where we can tell by looking at the code which customer likes to eat which food and each customer wont even know how to order food they don&#8217;t want to order.</p>

<h2>Introducing define_method and instance_exec</h2>

<p>Before we get into the final solution, the end result is that we can now do things like the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">fussy_customer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order_tarka_daal</span> <span class="c1"># returns an undefined method error</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Also when we look at each customer we can see very clearly what they like to eat and how they like to respond for each menu item.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/189a8ca40c7f0a0423d9235ff4ebe3fc.js"></script>


<p>The nice thing is that if the restaurant adds a new menu item, we don&#8217;t need to touch the <code>DiningOut</code>
module at all. We just need to decide which customers would like to order the new menu item and how they might optionally respond.</p>

<p>It works by defining a new class method <code>eats</code>. This method takes the name of the menu item and a
block to be called with the meal so the customer can inspect the meal to determine their response.</p>

<p>The <code>eats</code> class method in <code>DiningOut</code> uses <code>define_method</code> to dynamically create the <code>order_*</code> instance method on the customer. This means if the customer declares <code>eats :chips</code> then they will respond to the method <code>order_chips</code> (and conversely if they don&#8217;t define it then they will return undefined method error). This makes it very obvious what menu items the customer will eat and prevents mistakes.</p>

<p>The order method uses <code>instance_exec</code> to execute the response block passed in. This is required because we want to ensure the block is called on the customer instance and not in the context of the class method - if we just did <code>block.call(meal)</code> then an undefined method (for whatever method the response block called) would be raised.</p>

<p>By accepting a block and calling it with <code>instance_exec</code> gives the nice benefit of that block being able to call any method it likes on the instance. In this scenario each <code>Customer</code> can call a different response method, for each type of menu item, if they want. This is important because, for example, the <code>Chips</code> menu item does not respond to the method <code>spiceyness</code> - so if there was a single assumed <code>respond_to_meal</code> method each <code>Customer</code> implemented it would have to handle every type of meal (checking if it responds to methods such as <code>spiceyness</code> and all sorts of other logic).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Obviously this is a ridiculously contrived and long example to demonstrate two metaprogramming methods in Ruby but hopefully if you&#8217;ve read this far, you&#8217;ve got something out of it.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the intro, these metaprogramming methods should be used with caution. Powerful and concise code does not necessarily make for easy to understand/debug/maintain code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme">Enzyme</a> is a React Testing utility written
by the developers at Airbnb that is designed to make testing your components
much simpler and easier.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick tip for testing <code>onClick</code> functions where your code calls <code>event.preventDefault()</code></p>

<p>When triggering a click via the Enzyme api method <code>simulate</code>, you are not actually triggering a real event – the underlying implementation is simply calling the <code>onClick</code> prop of the node.</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;re calling <code>event.preventDefault()</code> in your code, you will need to pass
a second argument to <code>simulate</code>, which is a mock object, that is passed through to the event handler.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>const wrapper = shallow(&lt;YourComponent /&gt;);
</span><span class='line'>wrapper.find('a').simulate('click', { preventDefault() {} });</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Easy when you know how, but not immediately obvious. Fortunately the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/api/ShallowWrapper/simulate.md">Enzyme docs</a> are brilliant and well worth checking out for further detail and examples.</p>

<time datetime="2017-02-08T19:08:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 8<span>th</span>, 2017</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This article is going to explain how to perform and test Ajax requests in a React
application using Redux and <a href="https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios">Axios</a> which
is a promise based HTTP client.</p>

<p>I like Axios because of the way you can centrally configure the common behaviour
for the requests your front-end needs to make and the responses it receives.
To take one example, it has the concept of <a href="https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios#interceptors">interceptors</a>
that allow you to write a single function that can the handle responses such
as a 401 unauthorized or 500 exception.</p>

<p>When using Axios I like to create a utility &#8216;Service&#8217; class to setup the centralised
config and ensure all Ajax requests get handled consistently.</p>

<p>It also means calls to Axios are not sprinkled all over the codebase, so I could
swap out Axios for an alternative library and I should only need to update this
one wrapper class.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/ebfae1d1ac1779f18487d3dee80d1258.js"></script>


<p>In a Redux application, actions are purely functional and thus &#8216;side-effect free&#8217;. So in order to perform Ajax requests you will need middleware such as <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk">&#8216;redux-thunk&#8217;</a>. An alternative, that I&#8217;ve not used but heard good things of, is <a href="https://github.com/redux-loop/redux-loop">redux-loop</a>.</p>

<p>Redux Thunk means you can return a function from your action to delay the dispatch
of it, or only dispatch if a condition is met (like the response status is 200).</p>

<p>Once Redux Thunk is installed, you can return a function in your Action as shown by
<code>saveResource</code> in the example below:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/2335a83355a22a6d06bf72d2f462a776.js"></script>


<p>Then for any containers that you want to use the action, you need to pass through the dispatch to the function in the <code>mapDispatchToProps</code>. See <code>saveResource</code> below:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/dc495342470f006a6c60a97d29584456.js"></script>


<p>To test the action you can use standard jasmine spy functions:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/adcc72f752fa5381bc0ca22c0be91c32.js"></script>


<p>Then finally to test the Service class:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/paulsturgess/f1813e0cee2d39ea3b57ca155ec7fee7.js"></script>


<p>There are a few bits here to go through here. Firstly I found that when running the specs
I needed to add the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-polyfill">babel-polyfill</a> for Promises. I&#8217;m using <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html">Karma test runner</a> so I needed to add <code>'node_modules/babel-polyfill/dist/polyfill.js'</code> to the files array in the karma.config.js
file.</p>

<p>Secondly at the top of the spec you&#8217;ll notice that <a href="https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-ajax">jasmine-ajax</a> is imported. This is the official plugin for faking Ajax requests in your Jasmine specs. What I like about this
is that it has no knowledge of Axios. In the <code>beforeEach</code> it is turned on and
then all Ajax requests triggered in the specs are captured and can be inspected.</p>

<p>Due to the asynchronous nature of the promise, I use <code>setTimeout</code> to grab the
most recent request and check it was formed correctly. To test the callback
I use the <code>then</code> function on the promise under test.</p>

<p>A small, but important, detail is the call to <code>done()</code> – this ensures the test
does not exit early and waits until the asynchronous part of the test is complete
before exiting.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s it! There&#8217;s a lot of code there, but once the Service class is setup it
should remain pretty much unchanged. Adding additional Ajax requests to your React application actions should be fairly straight forward.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara">Capybara</a> is a great way for performing
integration testing of web applications. Typically it is used in development with
the default Rack Test Driver. However, the Rack Test driver does not support JavaScript
and is unable to access HTTP resources outside of your Rack application.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> – a headless implementation of Webkit
that can execute JavaScript, external urls and works with Capybara. The easiest
way to get the two to talk together is via the <a href="https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist">Poltergeist gem</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When accepting file uploads from users of your application, you should always
check the file to ensure malicious content isn&#8217;t permitted.</p>

<p>If you have a simple Rails <code>file_field</code> in a multipart form, you&#8217;ll get a <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Http/UploadedFile.html">ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile</a>. This object wraps up the temporary uploaded file and has methods
like <code>content_type</code> and <code>original_filename</code>.</p>

<p>At first glance it sounds sensible to check the extension (determined from <code>original_filename</code>) along with the <code>content_type</code>, against a whitelist of allowed
values. However, if the pesky user has renamed the file extension before uploading
the file, your whitelist will not help you as even <code>content_type</code> will return the
incorrect value.</p>

<p>This is why checking the mime type of the file is important, but this is not
something Ruby does natively. There are a few Ruby gems around which specifically
handle this problem but the simplest solution I found, without requiring any third
party dependencies, was to use the underlying Operating System and execute the
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html">file command</a> via back ticks:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby">  <span class="sb">`file --b --mime-type &#39;/path/to/file.txt&#39;`</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This works on both Linux and OS X and will return the mime type such as
&#8216;text/plain&#8217;, which can then be used as part of your validation.</p>
